** Amazon
Set ~AMAZON_EMAIL~, ~AMAZON_PASSWORD~, and ~AMAZON_TOTP_SECRET~ (for 2fa) environment
variables. For getting the TOTP secret, register a new 2fa application on
amazon. You will also have to enable it once by putting OTP back to the website
after doing something like this:

#+begin_src python
  import pyotp
  totp = pyotp.TOTP(totp_secret)
  totp.now() # Put this back in Amazon website to enable 2fa auth from the script
#+end_src

Then run:
#+begin_src shell
uv run amazon_orders.py
#+end_src
